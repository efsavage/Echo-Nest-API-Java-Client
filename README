This is a Maven-ized fork of the Echo Nest API Java Client (AKA jEN).

The original is at: http://code.google.com/p/jen-api/

Notes:

* Current as of Revision 66 of the original project (June 17, 2011).
* Requires Java 5.
* I did not edit the source files at all and can take no credit for things you like or don't like about it :)
* Please report any issues to the original project.
* Tests are disabled in the pom, and will probably not work for you as they require files that do not exist in the original project.
* I have verified that the project builds and am using it myself.
* I have not run any of the included shell scripts.
